        <h1>Who is Misael?..........</h1>
        <p>I would like to think I'm a Jack of all Trades. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico until the age of 12.
            Then I moved to Connecticut because my father was in the Navy. Then at 15 years old I moved to California,
            and I lived there until the age of 18. At the age of 18 i joined the Navy and was stationed in Japan for 3
            years, then in Virginia for 4 years.
        </p>
        <p>After the Navy, I went back to California where I lived there for another 4 year. California was super
            expensive and I absolutely hated living there. I didn't like how materialistic people were there, and how
            everything revolved around the things that you had. It was also incredibly difficult to meet people there,
            it just felt like everyone had their walls up whenever you talked to them. After California I moved back to
            Puerto Rico where I feel that I have made the most progress so far. I'm trying to finally settle down and
            I'm trying to finally do what I've always wanted to do which is work on art, computers and being a
            developer.</p>
